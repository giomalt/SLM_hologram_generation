# SLM_hologram_generation
Python program to generate the hologram of a phase-only SLM to produce a desired mode profile and compensate for its curvature and cavity spurious effects, as shown in  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01561

You can calculate the hologram for your phase-only SLM following this jupyter notebook:
